# Alpamayo 1

[**Code**](https://github.com/NVlabs/alpamayo) | [**Paper**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00088)

_Note: Following the release of [NVIDIA Alpamayo](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/alpamayo-autonomous-vehicle-development) at CES 2026, Alpamayo-R1 has been renamed to Alpamayo 1._

## Model Overview

### Description:

Alpamayo 1 integrates Chain-of-Causation reasoning with trajectory planning to enhance decision-making in complex autonomous-driving scenarios. Alpamayo 1 (v1.0) was developed by NVIDIA as a vision-language-action (VLA) model that bridges interpretable reasoning with precise vehicle control for autonomous-driving applications.

This model is ready for non-commercial use.

## Model Architecture:

**Architecture Type:** Transformer

**Network Architecture:** A VLA model based on Cosmos-Reason and featuring a diffusion-based trajectory decoder.

**This model was developed based on:** Cosmos-Reason (VLM backbone) with a diffusion-based action decoder

**Number of model parameters:**

- Backbone: 8.2B parameters
- Action Expert: 2.3B parameters

## Input(s):

**Input Type(s):** Image/Video, Text, Egomotion History

**Input Format(s):**

- Image: Red, Green, Blue (RGB)
- Text: String
- Egomotion History: Floating-point values `(x, y, z), R_rot`

**Input Parameters:**

- Image: Two-dimensional (2D), multi-camera, multi-timestep
- Text: One-dimensional (1D)
- Egomotion History: Three-dimensional (3D) translation and nine-dimensional (9D, 3x3) rotation, multi-timestep

**Other Properties Related to Input:**
Multi-camera images (4 cameras: front-wide, front-tele, cross-left, cross-right) with 0.4 second history window at 10Hz (4 frames per camera), image resolution 1080x1920 pixels (processor will downsample them to 320x576 pixels). Text inputs include user commands. Images and egomotion history (16 waypoints at 10Hz) also require associated timestamps.
Note that the model is primarily trained and only tested under this setting.

## Output(s)

**Output Type(s):** Text, Trajectory

**Output Format(s):**

- Text: String (Chain-of-Causation reasoning traces)
- Trajectory: Floating-point values `(x, y, z), R_rot`

**Output Parameters:**

- Text: One-dimensional (1D)
- Trajectory: Three-dimensional (3D) translation and nine-dimensional (9D, 3x3) rotation, multi-timestep

**Other Properties Related to Output:**
Outputs 6.4-second future trajectory (64 waypoints at 10Hz) with position `(x, y, z)` and rotation matrix `R_rot` in ego vehicle coordinate frame.
Internally, the trajectory is represented as a sequence of dynamic actions (acceleration and curvature) following a unicycle model in bird's-eye-view (BEV) space.
Text reasoning traces are variable in length, describing driving decisions and causal factors.

Our AI models are designed and/or optimized to run on NVIDIA GPU-accelerated systems. By leveraging NVIDIA's hardware (e.g. GPU cores) and software frameworks (e.g., CUDA libraries), the model achieves faster training and inference times compared to CPU-only solutions.

## Software Integration:

**Runtime Engine(s):**

- PyTorch (minimum version: 2.8)
- Hugging Face Transformers (minimum version: 4.57.1)
- DeepSpeed (minimum version: 0.17.4)

**Supported Hardware Microarchitecture Compatibility:**

- NVIDIA GPUs with sufficient memory to load a 10B parameter model (minimum 1 GPU with at least 24GB of VRAM)

**Preferred/Supported Operating System(s):**

- Linux (we have not tested on other operating systems)

The integration of foundation and fine-tuned models into AI systems requires additional testing using use-case-specific data to ensure safe and effective deployment. Following the V-model methodology, iterative testing and validation at both unit and system levels are essential to mitigate risks, meet technical and functional requirements, and ensure compliance with safety and ethical standards before deployment.
